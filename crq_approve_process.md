### CRQ approval process change

Here is the change for CRQ approval process. **We do not need VP/director approval for `Normal` CRQs.** This is what I got from BTCM.

For non-high impact changes, you can leave the external ticket field blank as CVID code no longer required for changes in Q2.

For Q2 expectation, as long as the CRQ meets BTCM submission quality requirements, it can be reviewed and moved to Scheduled status, without a CVID code in place (Pre current condition process)

* **Normal changes within a MW (MW1/MW2/MW3/MW4 are Tues/Wed/Thurs/Sat 1-8AM EST) do not require director approval.**

* Normal changes â€“ Outside maintenance window or Expedited requires director approval in the tool.

* Lead time of 48 business hours required for Normal changes.

* Expedited requires 24 hour lead time to implementation window.  Submitter and implementer director approvals required in the tool.

* Pre-CAB is a meeting where the different Business units discuss what change/s are low risk and requires no VP Reliability ECAB review and what other CRQs require visibility at ECAB.
